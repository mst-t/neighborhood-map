# Montreal Island Map

## Description
This is a Udacity project to learn the MVVM pattern and Knockout.js
which is one of the JavaScript frameworks useful for creating single-page applications.
Icons and list items are displayed using the Google Map API and Knockout functions.
By clicking on them, the information on the location is displayed on the map using the Wikipedia API.
Also, I adopted the flat design, changed the design of the map, and selected icons suitable for it.
